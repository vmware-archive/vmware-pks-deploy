# vmware-pks-deploy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy)

This is a project intended to document and automate the process required for a PKS + NSX-T deployment on vSphere.

## Extra documents

These documents are not public yet.  They are linked here for VMware internal users, but should be converted over time into publicly consumable documents.

* Read
[Niran's step-by-step NSX-T deploy](https://onevmw-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/nevenchen_vmware_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B06F3406E-D0A2-42AE-9F5C-F35583D92EDF%7D&file=Deploy%20NSX-T%20with%20Concourse%20V1%2004-27-2018.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
for a step-by-step manual deploy using some automation
* Use the PoC [Planning Reference](https://vault.vmware.com/group/vault-main-library/document-preview?fileId=38127906) document to vet the planned deployment
* Use the [PKS Configuration Worksheet](https://vault.vmware.com/group/vault-main-library/document-preview?fileId=38127882) to identify and track needed configuration that must be captured as YAML for the pipelines to work properly

## High level end-to-end PKS deployment

The overall process for a PKS and NSX-T deployment is

* Start with a new vcenter, or a new cluster in an existing vcenter
* Deploy a PKS deployment server. This has Pivotal Concourse for running pipelines, and all the needed binaries and tools to do an automated deploy of PKS and NSX-T
* Use a default configuration YAML or create a new one for NSX-T and another for PKS. These describe what the final deployment will look like
* Apply the pipelines to your configuration
* Connect to the Concourse UI
* Trigger pipelines to:
  * deploy NSX-T
  * deploy PKS

To get the inital OVA, you must bootstrap.  That process looks is:

* Start with a machine with access to a vCenter
* Download this code as described below
* Create a container with tools needed to operate on vCenter
* Deploy a ubuntu 16.04 cloud image into vCenter
* Boot the stock VM using cloudinit to set usernames/passwords/ssh keys
* Run ansible playbooks against the VM to provision everything needed to make a deploy server, including:
  * install concourse
  * download and host needed binaries
  * host container images needed by concourse


At this point, you have two choices:

* export the VM as an OVA for a future deployment
* use the running VM to perform  a deploy now

Assuming you want to do these things, continue into the details of this process below:

## Get the code

***Do not clone this repository.***
Instead, [install Google Repo](https://source.android.com/source/downloading#installing-repo).

Here's a quick google repo install for the impatient.

```bash
# Validate python
python2.7 -c "print 'Python OK'" || echo 'Need python 2.7!'
python --version | grep "Python 2" || echo 'Warning: python 3 is default!'
mkdir ~/bin
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
# If you get a warning that about python 3, you might run this:
# After repo is installed:
sed -ri "1s:/usr/bin/env python:/usr/bin/python2.7:" ~/bin/repo
```

Once you've installed Google Repo, you will use it to download and assemble all the component git repositories.

This process is as follows:

``` bash
mkdir pks-deploy-testing
cd pks-deploy-testing
repo init -u https://github.com/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy-meta.git
# or, with ssh: (you will have first had to register an SSH key with Github)
repo init -u git@github.com:vmware/vmware-pks-deploy-meta.git
# Then sync, which pulls down the code.
repo sync
```

After pulling down all the code as described above, go into `pks-deploy-testing`
and you'll see there are several directories.  These are each a git repository.

We'll focus on the `pks-deploy` repository.

## Bootstrapping

Go into `pks-deploy/bootstrap`.
This directory contains code that will create a VM in vCenter, install Concourse, ansible, and other tools into that VM.

You can use an existing OVA captured after doing this process once, or you can go into the [bootstrap directory](bootstrap/)
and follow the readme there to create the VM directly in vCenter.

This should take about 15 minutes.

## Ssh into the jumpbox

Get the ip of the vm created in the bootstrap step above.
If you set up ssh keys, you can ssh right now, otherwise use:

* Username: `vmware`
* Password: `VMware1!`

On the jumpbox, there is also a copy of the source you used to bootstrap at `/home/vmware/deployroot`.

### Download VMware bits

If you passed the following variables into the bootstrap process above,
the required binaries will be downloaded as part of the automation: `PIVNET_API_TOKEN`, `MY_VMWARE_USER`, and `MY_VMWARE_PASSWORD`.
If you did not pass those in, then you'll need to run this step manually as described below.

Go into the jumpbox directory `/home/vmware/deployroot/pks-deploy/downloads`,
and follow the readme there to pull needed bits from http://my.vmware.com and pivnet.
You can see an online version in [downloads](downloads).

The downloaded files will be hosted via s3 by minio and
can be accessed at `http://bootstrap-box-ip:9091`.

### Apply various pipelines

On the jumpbox, the pipelines exist at `/home/vmware/deployroot` and concourse is running on `http://jumpbox-ip:8080` with the same credentials as ssh to log in.
You can use fly from the jumpbox to apply the pipelines. To log in try `fly --target main login -c http://localhost:8080` and `fly pipelines --target main`

#### Install NSX-T

cd `/home/vmware/deployroot/nsx-t-gen` and follow the guide from [sparameswaran/nsx-t-gen](https://github.com/sparameswaran/nsx-t-gen).

Anther good guide is [from Sabha](http://allthingsmdw.blogspot.com/2018/05/introducing-nsx-t-gen-automating-nsx-t.html)

A sample config file is at `/home/vmware/deployroot/deploy-params/one-cloud-param.yaml` on the jumpbox, or [live here](https://github.com/NiranEC77/NSX-T-Concourse-Pipeline-Onecloud-param/blob/master/one-cloud-param.yaml).

There is also good coverage of the config file needed in Niran's guide from above starting in section 4.b.

Once you have the config file correct:

``` bash
cd /home/vmware/deployroot/nsx-t-gen
fly --target main login -c http://localhost:8080 -u vmware -p 'VMware1!'
fly -t main set-pipeline -p deploy-nsx -c pipelines/nsx-t-install.yml -l ../pks-deploy/one-cloud-nsxt-param.yaml
fly -t main unpause-pipeline -p deploy-nsx
```

#### Install PAS and/or PKS

cd `/home/vmware/deployroot/nsx-t-ci-pipeline` and follow the guide from [sparameswaran/nsx-t-ci-pipeline](https://github.com/sparameswaran/nsx-t-ci-pipeline)

In particular, [this is the pipeline](https://github.com/sparameswaran/nsx-t-ci-pipeline/blob/master/pipelines/install-pks-pipeline.yml) and here is [a sample param file](https://github.com/sparameswaran/nsx-t-ci-pipeline/blob/master/pipelines/pks-params.sample.yml).

``` bash
cd /home/vmware/deployroot/nsx-t-ci-pipeline
fly --target main login -c http://localhost:8080 -u vmware -p 'VMware1!'
fly -t main set-pipeline -p deploy-pks -c pipelines/install-pks-pipeline.yml -l ../pks-deploy/pks-params.sample.yml
fly -t main unpause-pipeline -p deploy-pks
```
